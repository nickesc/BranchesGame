# Branches Script Text
# Intro 

Keeper: It's good to be back...

Keeper: Wonder what came in this time...

Keeper: Something to worry about tomorrow

Keeper: Thanks, Lou

Keeper: What time is it? Ugh...

Keeper: Better get started on those things Lou mentioned

## Gone Up Branch

Keeper: That doesn't look good...

Keeper: What's that on the water?

Keeper: Oh no... That ship is gonna crash straight into the beach!

Keeper: I need to turn on the light to signal them, they can't tell in the dark that theres an island in front of them.

Keeper: You've gotta be kidding me, Lou. You broke the igniter

Keeper: I should try to radio them, they still can't see a thing out there

Keeper: Crap, no answer

Keeper: What am I gonna do now?


### Alternatives Branch

Keeper: Forget the light, there are other ways to signal a ship.

Keeper: I know the foghorn on the boat I came in on was pretty loud. Or...

#### Foghorn Branch

Keeper: I hope this is loud enough...

*CRASH*

Keeper: Oh no...

#### Blaze Branch

Keeper: I cant believe I'm doing this...

Keeper: Thank God, it worked...

### Fix the Light Branch

Keeper: I guess I'd better find a way to fix this light

#### Attack Lou Branch

Keeper: Lou! You broke the damn light! I need you to fix it!

Lou: I broke- Wha-?

*CRASH*

Keeper: Oh no...

#### Fix it Yourself Branch

Keeper: Thank God, it worked...

## Gone Out Branch

Lou: Good to see ya, bud!

Keeper: Hey Lou, good to see you too. Got the canisters ready?

Lou: The gas is over there in the corner, I unloaded a shipment last night. Should be plenty to last a while

Lou: See ya later!

Keeper: There's a tree down by the snake-path, got anything that can help with that?

Lou: There should be a saw around back, you could try that.

Keeper: I wonder who lit that...
